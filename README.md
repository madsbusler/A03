In order to understand how to use Git and Github, there are a variety of terms we need to learn the definitions of. 

Definitions

GIT: an open source code management software 

Github: a web based version control and collaboration platform for software developers

Repository: A storage location where software packages can be retrieved and installed to a computer

Clone: an exact copy of the source code 

Commit: A synonym for save; this works in the same way as the save button. 

Push: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository, like one that is hosted on Github

Pull: A way to tell others that you've made changes to a project and it allows others to collaborate on the project. 

Branch: A repository that has been copied from one member's account to another member's account

Merge: bringing in the committed changes from a branch into the source code

Merge Conflict: happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge

Fetch: pulling all the work done by someone else and all of their branches without merging the information

Remote: a commmon repository that all members use to exchange their changes 

Now that we have all of the definitions, we can understand how to use github. Github is extrememly easy to use; to begin you would create your own account and then create a new repository. This repository name should be the title of the project you are working on. Once you are in the repository you can begin editing the project, making small changes and committing them one at a time instead of making all the changes at once.

Using these definitions above it is very easy to understand how to make a pull request and merge the data from another member's project to your own, making sure there are no areas that will create a merge conflict.
