In order to understand how to use Git and Github, there are a variety of terms we need to learn the definitions of. 

Definitions

GIT: an open source code management software 

Github: a web based version control and collaboration platform for software developers

Repository: A storage location where software packages can be retrieved and installed to a computer

Clone: an exact copy of the source code 

Commit: A synonym for save; this works in the same way as the save button. 

Push: Sending your committed changes to a remote repository, like one that is hosted on Github

Pull: A way to tell others that you've made changes to a project and it allows others to collaborate on the project. 

Branch: A repository that has been copied from one member's account to another member's account

Merge: bringing in the committed changes from a branch into the source code

Merge Conflict: happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge

Fetch: pulling all the work done by someone else and all of their branches without merging the information

Remote: a commmon repository that all members use to exchange their changes
